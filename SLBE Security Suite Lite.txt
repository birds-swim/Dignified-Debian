1. INTRODUCTION

List of software used to LIGHTLY improve/enhance the security of the base Debian system.
Extreme security hardening is outside the scope of this project, which is to provide
family members with an easy-to-use Linux system that is slightly more secure than the
stock Debian/Spiral Linux defaults (and default packages). 

For this project Convenience > Security.

If you're looking for a hardened setup with Linux, then please consider:
(1) secureblue  https://github.com/secureblue/secureblue
(2) Kicksecure  https://www.kicksecure.com

They are the most reasonable options before you reach Qubes OS.

RULE #1:
DON'T HECK WITH THE USER. Ideally, I want the security improvements to be almost
invisible to the User. Their workflow should not be interrupted. The system shouldn't
be so secure/locked down that they can't get any work done and it becomes too
inconvenient/annoying to use.

INTERNET SECURITY:
# The plan goes something like this: Hosts file + NextDNS + uBlock Origin outta do
# the trick. 
# My idea behind using the Hosts file is to make sure that the user never has the 
# chance to resolve explicitly malicious/malware domains. Hopefully we can say:
# "Hard to get malware on your computer if you can't go into harm's way". NextDNS
# helps us get secure/encrypted DNS, additional content filtering of ads/trackers,
# and provides us with some very nice analytics about which good domains are
# accidentally blocked and being able to whitelist them on the fly (the unofficial 
# Android app is super handy for this). It would be harder to whitelist the Hosts file
# when you're AFK. Sure, you could use SSH, but the (unofficial) NextDNS app is much
# easier/faster.
