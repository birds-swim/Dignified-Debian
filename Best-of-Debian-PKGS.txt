###        BEST OF DEBIAN PACKAGES          ###
###############################################

# This text file is a list containing the very best software available
# from the Debian Stable repositories. It's a currated list containing
# software packages that I have researched myself and from community suggestions
# from r/Debian.
#
# For details what the Debian Community recommended, please see:
# https://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/1eu6wcr/what_are_some_must_have_pieces_of_software_that/
# 
# I plan to use this list today and for future installs of Spiral Linux Builder Edition.
# I hope to upload this to GitHub or [somewhere else] for easy access.
#
# This is my greatest "Essentials Kit". It contains everything that a Spiral Linux
# system would need to be truly great and improve Quality of Life for the User and
# for however long the system is used.
#
# The core principles behind this list are: Reliability/Dependability, Ease-of-Use,
# and Verbosity. Verbosity: packages that help inform the User what's going on in
# their system. Example: The needrestart package from the debian-goodies lets
# the User know if they need to restart their computer after apt upgrade is performed.
#
# This list should be fed to apt-get and NOT apt. apt-get is better suited for
# shell scripts and other fancy Terminal Magic/Linux Fu.
